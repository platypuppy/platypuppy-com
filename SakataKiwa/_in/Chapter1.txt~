# Chapter 1: “The Investigation”

Due to her club running late, the girl was biking home from school,
taking a shortcut through the forbidden zone. A robotic voice announced,
“Gate detected. Coordinates margin of error: 8.03.” She looked up as
the gate opened above her. She froze, not knowing what to do, as the
marmodd dropped from the gate. Instincts kicking in, the girl drew
her sword. She swung it downward onto the marmodd’s head, but it was
unfazed. She took a step backwards into a defensive stance as she
realised the situation, yet the marmodd took this opening to slice
her sword in half. Panicking, she dropped the remnants of her sword and fled on her bike.

Two hours later, Suwa Squad, who defeated the marmodd, was writing an After Action Report. “Did any of ‘ya notice the small dent on the marmodd when we arrived?” Suwa asked. Hisato replied, “I thought it was my brain playing tricks on me...” “Huh, that’s odd… I guess we might as well include it,” Daichi added on.

Soon after, the cleaning crew arrived at the incident location. Around the destroyed marmodd were two sword pieces. “Hey, Chizu! Why is there a wooden sword? Are border agents using wooden swords now?” Ishi called out. “Ishi, just put it into an evidence bag,” Chizu replied condescendingly, “it’s probably the result of the damage that Suwa Squad reported,” she continued.
